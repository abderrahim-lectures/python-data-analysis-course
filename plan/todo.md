# Active TODO — queued mid-session, 2026-08-30

Tracking list for requests that came in faster than they could be finished.
Check items off as they land; move detail write-ups to `astro-rebuild.md`'s
status log once done, don't duplicate here.

- [x] **i18n URL segment translation** — done. Locale routes restructured
      from `/ar/learn` → `/ar/تعلم`, `/es/learn` → `/es/aprender`,
      `/fr/learn` → `/fr/apprendre`, and `/projects` → `/مشاريع`/
      `/proyectos`/`/projets`. Track words in the URL too (`normal`/`hard`
      → `عادي`/`صعب`, `dificil`, `difficile`). Content slugs (`python-101`,
      `data-analysis`, project slugs) stay untranslated — gameState/XP keys
      shared across locales. Added `src/lib/routeSegments.ts` (word map +
      href builders) and `src/lib/pageStrings.ts` (localized titles/copy
      for the learn hub + projects index, the two pages whose text was
      hardcoded English rather than pulled from content). Added `hreflang`
      alternate `<link>` tags to `Base.astro` via a new `alternates` prop,
      wired through all 5 locale route templates. Verified: Unicode (Arabic)
      directory names build fine on disk, canonical/hreflang URLs
      percent-encode correctly, titles render translated
      (`تعلّم — PyDA`/`Aprender — PyDA`/`Apprendre — PyDA`).
      Old `/ar/learn` etc. URLs are gone with no redirect (site isn't
      indexed yet — same call as the earlier `/stats` removal).
- [x] **Custom domain / base path fix**: discovered mid-session that
      production is `https://pyda-course.online/` (custom domain), not
      `github.io/python-data-analysis-course/`. `astro.config.mjs` was
      still assuming the GH Pages repo-subpath. Added `public/CNAME`,
      fixed `site`/`base` — this was silently breaking every canonical URL,
      OG tag, and the sitemap.
- [x] **Button hover states audit**: `.btn-streak`/`.btn-xp` and
      `.route-pill--normal/--hard` (both EN and locale `/learn` hubs) had
      `:active` press feedback but no `:hover` at all — fixed all of them.
- [x] **Top nav icon check**: the Progress icon (a two-dot winding-path
      glyph) was illegible at 15px, just read as a stray squiggle —
      redesigned as a flag glyph, reads clearly now. Learn/Projects icons
      were already fine once Projects got its dedicated globe icon (see
      "already done" section below).
- [x] **Locale hub "Track 1"/"Track 2" badge** was still hardcoded English
      on the ar/es/fr learn hubs even after the rest of the page translated
      — added `track1`/`track2` to `pageStrings.ts`, fixed.
- [ ] **Add the full playground**: known gap from earlier in the session —
      no dedicated `/playground` page exists yet, only inline `RunnableCell`
      cells per-lesson. The old Docusaurus `VsCodePlayground` React
      component (Monaco + JupyterLite terminal, ~615 lines across 4 files)
      was never ported. This is a large, separate feature — needs its own
      scoping pass (what's the MVP: just a bigger Monaco editor + run
      button? A saved-snippets sidebar? JupyterLite notebook mode?) before
      implementation starts.

## Already done this session (for context, not re-tracked)
Astro promoted to repo root + Docusaurus removed · UI chrome i18n
(nav/footer/onboarding) · stats+progress merged into one page · project
card art restored (per-project gradient + tag emoji, was a flat 🌍 for
every card) · footer redesign · KaTeX strict-mode warnings silenced.
See `astro-rebuild.md` for full detail.
